            It's not sunny today. My fish drowned
            <br>
            <br>
            小朋友写：妹妹乱跑，跑到天涯海角。
            <br>
            老师的评语：你妹妹可真会跑。
            <br>
            Children write: sister ran around, ran to the ends of the world.
            <br>
            Teacher's comment: your sister can really run.
            <br>
            <br>
            小朋友写：我因为饿了所以要吃饭
            <br>
            老师的评语：那是当然的。
            <br>
            I want to eat because I am hungry
            <br>
            Teacher's comment: of course.
            <br>
            <br>
            上课时，小朋友造句：“昨天我吃了水果然后喝了凉水。“
            <br>
            老师说：“ ‘果然’ 是词组，不能分开造句。”
            <br>
            小朋友又说：“老师，我还没说完呢。果然晚上我拉肚子了！”
            <br>
            In class, the child made a sentence: "yesterday I ate fruit and drank cold water. "
            <br>
            The teacher said, "sure enough" is a phrase, you can't make sentences separately. "
            <br>
            The child said, "teacher, I haven't finished yet. I have diarrhea at night! "
            <br>
            <br>
            有一道语文题，要求用“有......有......还有......”造句。
            <br>
            一个学生是这样写的：姥姥给我拿了鱼，我吃完了问姥姥还有吗，姥姥答：“有，有，还有！”
            <br>
            There is a Chinese question, which requires "there are... There are... There are..." to make sentences.
            <br>
            One student wrote this: grandma brought me fish. After I finished eating, I asked grandma if she had any more. Grandma replied, "yes, yes, there are!"
